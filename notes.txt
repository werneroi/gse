id: a random number for each event must have!
title: a name for the event - can be changed so do I need it?
resourceId - must have!
description:  status : original_Luid : otherSide_Luid : originalSideEventId : otherSideEventId :requestId


when I recieve an event I need to get to the user and the event as quick as possible.
If i have the luid of each side I can take the relative snapInfo quick.



THOUHTS ON THINGS TO DO:

when an invitation is declined - currently I delete it on both side. should it be kept as open time? 
should I give the originaluser the option to delete it?

edit invitation - currently dissabled.
